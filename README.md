# NBA Leaderboard Data Analytics

This is a small project that showcases data analytics of NBA leaderboard data, which was obtained using the API method. The project consists of a google colaboratory notebook file that demonstrates various data analysis techniques on the obtained data.

## Data Source

The data was obtained using the NBA API, which is a Python package that provides programmatic access to the NBA data. Specifically, the data used in this project was obtained from the stats endpoint of the API.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following files:

**nba_sm.ipynb:** This is the colaboratory notebook file that contains the data analytics code. /n
**nba_sm.py** This is the python file if someone wants to run it in different ide. /n
**README.md:** This file, which provides an overview of the project. /n
The Colaboratory notebook file includes the following sections:

_Data Extraction:_ This section explains how the data was extracted using the NBA API (https://stats.nba.com/stats/leagueLeaders?LeagueID=00&PerMode=PerGame&Scope=S&Season=2011-12&SeasonType=Regular%20Season&StatCategory=PTS).
_Data Cleaning:_ This section explains how the data was cleaned to prepare it for analysis.
_Exploratory Data Analysis:_ This section contains various data analysis techniques, such as visualization and summary statistics, to explore the data.
Conclusion: This section summarizes the findings of the data analysis.

## Requirements

To run the Colaboratory notebook file, you will need to install the following packages:

**pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn**
You can install these packages using pip or conda. 
For example, to install the required packages using pip, you can run the following command:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn 
Running the Colaboratory Notebook

To run the Colaboratory / Jupyter notebook file, you can open it using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab or Google Colaboratory. You can then run each cell of the notebook to execute the code.

## Credits

NBA API for providing the NBA data.
